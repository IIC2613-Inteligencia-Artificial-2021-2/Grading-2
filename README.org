* Judge
** Testing procedure
   There's a problem-specific validator that runs multiple ASP programs with
   ~clingo~ to test the implementation. It reports simplified models and issues
   with them, if any.

   Models are computed for composite ASP programs,
   - Assignment-specific files:
    - generic base files, if any. e.g: ~planning/strips.lp~
    - problem-specific model. e.g: ~csat/dep_hell/dh.lp~, ~planning/coffee/coffee.lp~
   - Common test files:
    - instance file. e.g: [[./tests/csat/dep_hell/instances/2/instance.lp]]
    - test file. e.g: [[./tests/csat/dep_hell/instances/0/pos-0.lp]]
      - There's positive tests, which are expected to need models, and negative
        test, which are expected to make the program unsatisfiable.

** Scoring
   Problems get partial score for every passed instance. Each instance must pass
   all positive and negative tests to pass.

   There's a script that calls the validator with the right configuration to run
   all the tests, [[./grade.fish]], which outputs the test execution results, and a
   small program that computes grades from the execution outputs,
   [[./collect_grades.py]]. This separation is meant to allow re-generating full
   reports without re-executing all the tests again.
